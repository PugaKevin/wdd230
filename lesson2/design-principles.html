            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <picture><img src="../lesson2/images/monkey.png" alt="picture of rule of thirds from monkey survey"> </picture>
            <p>A composition guidline that places your subject in the left or right third of an image,
                leaving the other two thirds more open. It is easier to do when you draw gridlines on 
                your art work or website. On this example the yellows pulls you to the right side, then 
                immediatly you look at the persons face. The rule of thirds divides the picture into 3 
                that will draw your attention too.<br>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <picture><img src="../lesson2/images/wiki.png" alt="repetition picture from wikipedia"></picture>
            <p>Really self explanatory however, the concept must stay the same in order for people to
                understand that they are in your website. For this reason wikipedia is one of the best
                ones. The common work and repetition makes it very easy for people to understand where
                they are and how to navigate.The reason this one works so well is because with wikipedia
                you have the same layout and repetition when it comes to content. It has a picutre on the
                left followed by explanation on whatever you are looking for. Then follow by history or other
                things related to it.<br>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <picture><img src="../lesson2/images/fortnite.png" alt="contrast from epicgames with colors"></picture>
            <p>Contrast can help clarify white elements and the space as well as format. It can help
                with the shape and color and texture of the design and picture as well. This is a 
                great example because not only does it use the contrast for the words, but the picture 
                themselves help you the font stick out more. They didn't just use dark pictures, they 
                also use other colors to blend it all in nicely with the white space.<br>
