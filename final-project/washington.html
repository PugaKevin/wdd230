            <h2 class="title">The Cotton Mission</h2>
            <div class="history101">
                <p> Thousands of people left their homes to come to Northern Utah to find a new life, and to live the religion of their choice. 
                    Arriving exhausted and ill, having hastily buried hundreds of loved ones along the way, they started their new lives. From 
                    this weary group, Brigham Young asked thirty-eight (38) families, all from the southern states, to travel to Southern Utah 
                    to grow cotton. These southerners were from Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, Tennessee and the Carolinas. This was the 
                    Cotton Mission, or sometimes called the Southern Mission. Washington City was the first town established in the Virgin basin 
                    for the purpose of colonizing the land so that cotton could be grown. "Grow cotton," he challenged them, knowing that war 
                    between the North and South would soon erupt. Cotton would not be available for use by these Utah pioneers. This directive 
                    was given to people who had left the fertile South to make their trek to Utah. They knew how to grow cotton, or at least had 
                    seen it grown. These families were the forerunners of what would become known as "Utah's Dixie"-- so named by these stalwart 
                    Southerners, who were no doubt homesick for the lives they had left behind. The name spread to the surrounding areas known as 
                    "Utah's Dixie" today.

                <p>Top professional and age-group triathletes from around the world will test their mettle in the shadows of the stunning red rock canyons in 
                    St. George, Utah, at the 2022 Intermountain Healthcare IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship presented by Utah Sports Commission. The challenging 
                    course with breathtaking views of American Southwest scenery is an athlete-favorite that attracts the best in the sport and electrifying 
                    spectator support. In this desert of extremes, a land carved by ancient seas, a challenge lies waiting. Rise to it. This marks the first 
                    time the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship will be held in St. George, the home of IRONMAN St. George and IRONMAN 70.3 St. George.
